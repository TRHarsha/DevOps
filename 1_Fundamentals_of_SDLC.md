## 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1.1 Define SDLC

SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. It consists of six phases:

### 1.2 Phases of SDLC

a. **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:** Gather and understand the software requirements from stakeholders to define the scope and objectives of the project.

b. **Designing:** Create a detailed design plan, specifying the software architecture, system components, and their relationships.

c. **Development:** Write and build the actual code based on the design specifications, transforming the concept into a functional software product.

d. **Software Testing and Integration:** Thoroughly test the software for bugs and issues, integrating individual components to ensure they work seamlessly together.

e. **Production:** Deploy the software to a live environment, making it accessible to end-users and maintaining its functionality in a production setting.

f. **Maintenance:** Address ongoing needs, fix bugs, implement updates, and make improvements to ensure the software remains effective and efficient over time.
