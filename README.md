# DevOps Notes

## 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1.1 Define SDLC

SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. It consists of six phases:

a. **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:** Gather and understand the software requirements from stakeholders to define the scope and objectives of the project.

b. **Designing:** Create a detailed design plan, specifying the software architecture, system components, and their relationships.

c. **Development:** Write and build the actual code based on the design specifications, transforming the concept into a functional software product.

d. **Software Testing and Integration:** Thoroughly test the software for bugs and issues, integrating individual components to ensure they work seamlessly together.

e. **Production:** Deploy the software to a live environment, making it accessible to end-users and maintaining its functionality in a production setting.

f. **Maintenance:** Address ongoing needs, fix bugs, implement updates, and make improvements to ensure the software remains effective and efficient over time.

## 2. Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

## 3. Ingredients of DevOps

DevOps involves several key elements:

a. **Culture-shift:** Foster collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.

b. **Automation:** Implement automation to streamline the software delivery process.

c. **Measurement:** Use metrics to evaluate and improve the development and operational processes.

d. **Sharing Knowledge and Tools:** Encourage sharing of knowledge and tools across teams for better efficiency.

## 4. Principles of DevOps

a. **Customer Centric:** Focus on meeting customer needs and delivering value.

b. **Focus on End Product:** Emphasize the importance of the final product and its impact on users.

c. **End to End Responsibilities:** Encourage teams to take responsibility for the entire software delivery process.

d. **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

e. **Continuous Improvements:** Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement in all aspects of development and operations.

These principles and ingredients are fundamental to implementing and embracing DevOps practices successfully.
