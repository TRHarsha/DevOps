# Agile Methodology

### 3.1 Why Agile?

Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value in a world where we are constantly being challenged with Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. Organizations that I have seen go through Agile transformation have benefited from the following:

1. Faster time to market:
2. Early ROI
3. Feedback from Real Customers

Organizations that use Agile have benefitted:

1. Build the right product by prioritizing and understaning the right features for the product.

2. Early risk reduction where Agile provides the capability to identify the risk at the development stage itself.

3. Built-in Quality

4. Culture and Morale

### 3.2 Effficiency and Effectiveness

| Efficiency                 | Effectiveness                              |

| If the the process has to be fast we focus on efficiency.                    | If we are trying to be more creative,innovations and making sure we are working on the right thing we will focus on effectiveness. |
